            <h2>Our Mission & Goals</h2>
            <p>We believe coercive control and DARVO are the number one issues affecting the future of humanity. Our goal is to empower survivors, educate professionals, and advocate for systemic change by providing accessible tools and resources.</p>
            <h2>Why Coercive Control & DARVO Matter</h2>
            <p>These tactics undermine trust, safety, and well-being in families and communities. By exposing and documenting these patterns, we help protect future generations and support justice for survivors.</p>

                <li>Context-aware pattern recognition (cycles, escalation, repeated tactics)</li>
                <li>Unified coverage of Duluth Power and Control Wheels, NDCC Chapter 12, and modern slang</li>
